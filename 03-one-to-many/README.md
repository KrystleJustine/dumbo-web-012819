## Objectives

## Terminology
- Model: A class whose primary responsibility is to store data
- Domain: The subject matter of the problem, (e.g., Learn's domain is online education)
- Domain modeling: Creating models for your domain to represent real or abstract ideas (e.g., Learn's domain model includes modules, cohorts, assignments as well as their relationships)
- Relationships: How one model or thing is connected to another model or thing
  - One to many relationship: A relationship describing a single model that contains or keeps track of other models (a tree has many leaves, an organism has many cells, the universe has many galaxies)
  - Many to many relationship: Next time
  - Other relationships: Next time
- Why do we care so much about codifying and being really specific about the terminology of has-many/belongs-to? The terms are very powerful because we can use the same idea to describe relationships across many different types of domains. The relationship between artist and song, is the same as book and author, user and tweets, etc.
